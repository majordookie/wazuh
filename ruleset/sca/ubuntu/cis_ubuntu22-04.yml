  # 1.1.2 Configure /tmp
  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition (Automated)
  - id: 28500
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab or tmp.mount. Example of /etc/fstab configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options: tmpfs 0 /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Example of tmp.mount configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options: [Unit] Description=Temporary Directory /tmp ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=!/tmp DefaultDependencies=no Conflicts=umount.target Before=local-fs.target umount.target After=swap.target [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs."

Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion.

    description: "The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var/log on a separate partition is as follow. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/log directory contain the log files that can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var/log as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection of log data As /var/log contains log files, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log . For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    rationale: "With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves."
    impact: "The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting."
    remediation: "If there are no other packages that depends on autofs, remove the package with: # apt purge autofs OR if there are dependencies on the autofs package: Run the following commands to mask autofs: # systemctl stop autofs # systemctl mask autofs Additional Information: This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical media in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information being introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual mounting may not increase security."

Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry. The ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of -1 means \"unlimited\", the current default. A value of 0 means \"none\". There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified: kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o'-death (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped. limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag. lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps. noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric key for authentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field of the ntp.keys file. This restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain backward compatibility. Expect noepeer to become the default in ntp-4.4. nomodify - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries which attempt to modify the state of the server (i.e., run time reconfiguration). Queries which return information are permitted. noquery - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries. Time service is not affected. nopeer - Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new association. This includes broadcast and symmetric active packets when a configured association does not exist. It also includes pool associations, so if you want to use servers from a pool directive and also want to use nopeer by default, you'll want a restrict source ... line as well that does not include the nopeer directive. noserve - Deny all packets except ntpq and ntpdc queries. notrap - Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the ntpq control message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging programs. notrust - Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated. ntpport - This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port (123). Both ntpport and nonntpport may be specified. The ntpport is considered more specific and is sorted later in the list."
    rationale: "If ntp is in use on the system, proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is accurate."
    remediation: "Add or edit restrict lines in /etc/ntp.conf to match the following: restrict -4 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery OR If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove ntp from the system: # apt purge ntp Default Value: restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited."

    title: "Ensure SNMP Server is not installed."
    description: "Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. \"SNMPv2 historic\" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system."
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system. Note: If SNMP is required: The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message Encryption should be configured. If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values."

Run the following command before running ufw enable. # ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22 The rules will still be flushed, but the ssh port will be open after enabling the firewall. Please note that once ufw is 'enabled', ufw will not flush the chains when adding or removing rules (but will when modifying a rule or changing the default policy) By default, ufw will prompt when enabling the firewall while running under ssh. This can be disabled by using ufw --force enable"
    rationale: "The ufw service must be enabled and running in order for ufw to protect the system"
    impact: "Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command to unmask the ufw daemon: # systemctl unmask ufw.service Run the following command to enable and start the ufw daemon: # systemctl --now enable ufw.service active Run the following command to enable ufw: # ufw enable"

A system reboot will be required to load the rules into the running configuration. System call structure For performance (man 7 audit.rules) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page."

Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing information to the intruder.

    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured"
    description: "NOTE: To clarify, the two settings described below is only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they where abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en-abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinately, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."

NOTE: As of this writing it is not possible to customize the maximum number of retries for the creation of a password within recommended methods. The command pam-authupdate is used to manage certain PAM configurations via profiles, such as /etc/pam.d/common-password. Making a manual change to this file will cause pam-authupdate to overwrite it on the next run and is thus against recommendations. Alternatively, pam_pwquality (via /etc/security/pwquality.conf) fully supports the configuration of the maximum number of retries for a password change with the configuration entry retry = XXX. The issue is that the template /usr/share/pamconfigs/pwquality contains retry=3 which will override any retry setting in /etc/security/pwquality.conf as PAM entries takes precedence. This template file should not be modified as any package update will overwrite the change. Thus it is not possible, in any recommended way, to modify password retries."

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rwrw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----.

(examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells.

This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.

For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000. Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem.

Rationale: This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism as noted in Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted. Audit: Run the following command and verify that only "root" is returned: # awk -F: '($3 == 0) { print $1 }' /etc/passwd root Remediation: Remove any users other than root with UID 0 or assign them a new UID if appropriate.

Rationale: If the user's home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in "/" and will not be able to write any files or have local environment variables set. Audit: Run the following script to verify all local interactive user home directories exist: #!/usr/bin/env bash { output="" valid_shells="^($( sed -rn '/^\//{s,/,\\\\/,g;p}' /etc/shells | paste -s d '|' - ))$" awk -v pat="$valid_shells" -F: '$(NF) ~ pat { print $1 " " $(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd | (while read -r user home; do [ ! -d "$home" ] && output="$output\ - User \"$user\" home directory \"$home\" doesn't exist" done if [ -z "$output" ]; then echo -e "\ -PASSED: - All local interactive users have a home directory\ " else echo -e "\ - FAILED:\ $output\ " fi ) } Remediation: If any users' home directories do not exist, create them and make sure the respective user owns the directory. Users without an assigned home directory should be removed or assigned a home directory as appropriate. The following script will create a home directory for users with an interactive shell whose home directory doesn't exist: #!/usr/bin/env bash { valid_shells="^($( sed -rn '/^\//{s,/,\\\\/,g;p}' /etc/shells | paste -s - d '|' - ))$" awk -v pat="$valid_shells" -F: '$(NF) ~ pat { print $1 " " $(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd | while read -r user home; do if [ ! -d "$home" ]; then echo -e "\ - User \"$user\" home directory \"$home\" doesn't exist\ - creating home directory \"$home\"\ " mkdir "$home" chmod g-w,o-wrx "$home" chown "$user" "$home" fi done }"
